# React with socket io example

Testing react with socket.io

Install
```sh
  yarn install
```

Run server and client
```sh
  yarn dev
```

Room for improvment:
- Server side validation
- Immutable server states
  - Persistent data from some db
- Shared contract between server and client (eg. for msgs and events)
- Error handling in client
  - 4xx and 5xx
- Error handling in server 
  - Handle invalid incoming emit values etc..
